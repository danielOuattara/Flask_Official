"""
When returning HTML (the default response type in Flask), 
any user-provided values rendered in the output must be 
escaped to protect from injection attacks. 

HTML templates rendered with Jinja, introduced later, 
will do this automatically.

`escape()`, shown here, can be used manually. It is omitted 
in most examples for brevity, but you should always be aware 
of how you're using untrusted data.

If a user managed to submit the name <script>alert("bad")</script>, 
escaping causes it to be rendered as text, rather than running 
the script in the userâ€™s browser.

<name> in the route captures a value from the URL and passes 
it to the view function. These variable rules are explained below.
